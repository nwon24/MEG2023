  \question Find the next number in the sequence \[1,5,12,22,35,\ldots\]
  \question Twenty percent less than $60$ is one-third more than what number?
  \question What is the lowest common multiple of \(18\) and \(35\)?
  \question Find the cube root of \(3^{3^3}\). Note that \(a^{b^c}=a^{(b^c)}\).
  \question A triangle is inscribed in a circle of radius \(3\). Find the area
  of the triangle if its sides are in the ratio \(3:4:5\).
  \question In the plane, a lattice point is a point where both the \(x\)
  and \(y\) coordinates are whole numbers. The line \(y=55x/12\) is sketched
  for \(0<x<12\). How many lattice points are there on the line?
  \question Which number is the first number greater than \(1\) that is the cube of the sum of its digits?
  \question Evaluate \[\sqrt{(2023+2023)+(2023-2023)+(2023\times2023)+(2023\div2023)}.\]
  \question How many digits does \((2^22)^5\times(5^55)^2\) have?
  \question In how many ways can \(10\) objects be put into \(3\) bins
  such that one of the bins gets \(5\) objects, another gets \(3\) objects,
  and the third bin gets \(2\) objects?
  \question In the diagram below the side length of the square is \(1\).
  What is the radius of the smaller circle?

\question Josh writes the numbers $1,2,3,\dots,99,100$. He marks out $1$, skips the next number $(2)$, marks out $3$, and continues skipping and marking out the next number to the end of the list. Then he goes back to the start of his list, marks out the first remaining number $(2)$, skips the next number $(4)$, marks out $6$, skips $8$, marks out $10$, and so on to the end. Josh continues in this manner until only one number remains. What is that number?
\question Solve the equation \[7\sqrt x-22=\frac{24\sqrt x}{x}.\]
\question Five points are randomly placed in a square with side length \(2\).
The distance between every pair of points is measured, and the smallest
distance between a pair of points is called the \emph{minimum} distance. What
is the largest possible minimum distance?
\question For how many integer values of \(n\) (positive or negative) is the value of \[4000\cdot \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^n\] an integer?
  \question If \(\sin a+\sin b=\sqrt{5/3}\) and \(\cos a+\cos b=1\) what is \(\cos(a-b)\)?
  \question How many ways are there to write \(6\) as the sum of any number
  of positive integers?
  \question The number \[1+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cfrac{1}{2+\cdots}}}\] is the root of a quadratic. Find the sum of the roots of this quadratic.
    \question
  We have \(5\) disks of distinct sizes, and \(3\) pegs in a line. Let the left
  peg be \(A\) and the right-most peg be \(B\). The disks start off on \(A\) in
  descending order of size; the largest disk is at the bottom. What is the minimum
  number of moves required to transfer the entire stack of disks from \(A\) to \(B\)
  if a larger disk is not allowed to be placed on top of a smaller disk and \emph{direct
    transfers from \(A\) to \(B\) are not allowed?} This means every move must be made
  to or from the middle peg.
    \question Find \[1^3+2^3+3^3+\cdots+50^3\] given the following four
  equations. \[1 = 0 + 1\]\[2+3+4=1+8\] \[5+6+7+8+9=8+27\] \[10+11+12+13+14
    +15+16=27+64\]
