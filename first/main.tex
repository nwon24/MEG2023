\section*{Problems}
1. Find the last digit of $2^{2023}$. \\\\
2. Call an integer to be $gobbus$ if every digit is either 0 or 2 and it is divisible by 15. What is the smallest number that is gobbus? \\\\
3. Solve the equation $\frac{4t}{3}+2=2(t-2)$. \\\\
4. If $a,b,c > 0$ and $a+b+c=1$, prove that $a^2+b^2+c^2+1\ge4(ab+bc+ca)$.\\\\
5. Define the $alternating$ $sum$ of a set of positive integers has follows: List the elements of the set in decreasing order. Take the first number in the list, subtract the second, add the third, subtract the fourth, and so on. For example, the alternating sum of the set ${3,5,11,7}$ is $11-7+5-3=6$. Find the sum of the alternating sums of all the subsets of ${1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}$. \\\\
6. Suppose $BP$ and $CQ$ are bisectors of the angles $B$, $C$ of triangle ABC and suppose $AH$, $AK$ are the perpendiculars from $A$ to $BP$, $CQ$. Prove that $KH$ is parallel to $BC$.
