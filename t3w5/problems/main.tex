\section{Introduction}
1. Show that for every integer $n>1$ it is possible to write $\frac{1}{n}$ as a sum of two reciprocals of distinct positive integers.  \\\\
2. (AIME 1987/5) Find $3x^2 y^2$ if $x$ and $y$ are integers such that $y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517$. \\\\
3. Find all integer solutions to the equation $$(x-y)^2=x+y.$$\\\\
4. (AMC Intermediate 2021/30) Tyler has a large number of square tiles, all the same size. He has four times as many blue tiles as red tiles. He builds a large rectangle using all the tiles, with the red tiles forming a boundary 1 tile wide around the blue tiles. \\\\  He then breaks up this rectangle and uses the tiles to make two smaller rectangles. Like the large rectangle, each of the smaller rectangles has four times as many blue tiles as red tiles, and the red tiles form a boundary 1 tile wide around the blue tiles. How many blue tiles does Tyler have? \\\\
5. (Sophie Germain's Identity) Factor $a^4+4b^4$.
