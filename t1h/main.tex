\section*{Problems}
1. Find all natural numbers $n$ such that $2^{2^n}+5$ is prime. \\\\
2. Let $N$ be a regular nonagon, having $O$ as the centre of its circumcircle, and let $PQ$ and $QR$ be adjacent edges of $N$. The midpoint of $PQ$ is $A$ and the midpoint of the radius perpendicular to $QR$ is $B$. Determine the angle between $AO$ and $AB$.\\\\
3. Let $0<a<1$. Solve $$x^{a^x}=a^{x^a}$$ for positive numbers $x$. \\\\
4. Show that we can colour the elements of the set $S=\{1,2,\ldots, 2007\}$ with 4 colours such that any subset of $S$ with 10 elements, whose elements form an arithmetic sequence, is not all one colour. \\\\
5. Two points $K$ and $L$ are chosen inside triangle $ABC$ and a point $D$ is chosen on the side $AB$. Suppose that $B$, $K$, $L$, $C$ are concyclic, $\angle AKD = \angle BCK$ and $\angle ALD = \angle BCL$. Prove that $AK = AL$.
