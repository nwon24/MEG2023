\section{Introduction}
1. What is the measure of an angle, in degrees, if its supplement is six times its complement? \\\\
2. The point $O$ is the center of the circle circumscribed about $\triangle ABC$, with $\angle BOC = 120^{\circ}$ and $\angle AOB = 140^{\circ}$. What is the degree measure of $\angle ABC$?\\\\
3. (Inscribed angle theorem) Prove that if $\angle ACB$ is inscribed in a circle, then it subtends an arc with measure 2$\angle ACB$. \\\\
4. (Russia 1996) Points $E$ and $F$ are on side $\overline{BC}$ of convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ (with E closer to B). It is known that $\angle BAE = \angle CDF $ and $\angle EAF = \angle FDE $. Prove that $\angle FAC = \angle EDB$ \\\\
5. (USAJMO 2011/5) Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ lie on a circle $\omega$ and point $P$ lies outside the circle. The given points are such that (i) lines $PB$ and $PD$ are tangent to $\omega$, (ii) $P$, $A$, $C$ are collinear, and (iii) $\overline{DE} \parallel \overline{AC}$. Prove that $\overline{BE}$ bisects $\overline{AC}$.
