\section{Problems relating to combinatorial games}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A pile of $a$ stones is given. Two players play the following game: each of them in turns takes 1,2 or 3 stones. The player who takes the last stone wins. Determine, in terms of $a$, who has a winning strategy. 
\item  In the game $Double Chess$, the rules of chess are changed so that White and Black alternately make two legal moves at a time. Show that Black doesnâ€™t have a winning strategy 
\item Two players start with the number 1 and take turns to multiply it by an integer from 2
to 9. The winner is the first player to obtain a number greater than or equal to 1000. Which player has a winning strategy? 
\item All cells of a $4 \times 4$ table are painted white. In turn two players paint a white cell black. If a player makes a move, after which there is a black square $2 \times 2$, the player loses. Who has a winning strategy?
\item Two players in turn write $S$ or $O$ in an empty cell of a $1 \times 2000$ table. The first player who produces three consecutive boxes that spell SOS wins. If all boxes are filled without producing SOS then the game is a draw. Prove that the second player has a winning strategy.
